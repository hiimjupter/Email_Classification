# Email_Classification

**Text Classification** is a widely recognized problem in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. The goal is to build a program capable of categorizing text into predefined classes. 

In this project, we focus on developing a Text Classification system to classify messages as either spam or not spam using the Naive Bayes algorithm. This repository showcases the implementation of this algorithm to effectively filter and classify email content, providing a practical solution to spam detection.
